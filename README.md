# Payde (mPOS) ðŸš€
Payde is a merchant payments app, powered by (Finrock)[https://finrock.io]. It provides low-cost crypto payments to MSMEs; merchants can receive 200+ crypto assets for their usual products and services, and they get paid in their local currency. 

## Pronounciation ðŸ—£
The word "payde" is not a standard English word. However, if it is meant to be a misspelling of "paid", it is pronounced as "payd". The "ai" in "paid" makes the long "a" sound, as in "day". 

## Why Payde? ðŸ¤”
- We charge lowest (under 1%) as compared to our competitors, who charge north of 2%.
- We provide same-day fiat settlement and real-time crypto settlement as opposed to several days of settlement with other companies. 
- We provide them a mobile app based POS software that makes it easy for merchants to accept payments from anywhere
- We provide them with a risk screening system/fraud detection built-in that keeps them safe from bad actors. We automate compliance (AML, KYC, tax reporting).
- We also provide no-code widgets for online merchants who do not have the technical capability for API integrations. 
- We safeguard against crypto price volatility by guaranteeing merchants a fiat price
